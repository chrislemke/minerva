# Minerva
**Machina Intellectus Novum Examinis Ratio Verificatio Automata**

## Overview
Minerva is an AI-powered tool that automatically generates PyTest unit tests for Python code. Named after the Roman goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare, Minerva "strategically" analyzes your Python modules and creates test suites using Large Language Models.

## Disclaimer
Minerva is still in its early stages of development. The current version of Minerva is just a proof-of-concept - for now. Please handle with care.
